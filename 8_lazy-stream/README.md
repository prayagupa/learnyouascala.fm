Bloxorz is a game in Flash, which you can access at [coolmaths-games](http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz/index.html). 
As a first step for this assignment, play it for a few levels.

The objective of Bloxorz is simple; you must navigate your rectangular block to the hole at the end of the board, by rolling it, 
in the fewest number of moves possible. 
A block can be moved in 4 possible directions, left, right, up, down, using the appropriate keys on the keyboard.

You will quickly notice that for many levels, you are, in your head, trying to walk through different configurations/positions of 
where the block can be in order to reach it to the goal position. Equipped with some new programming skills, you can now let your computer do the work!

The idea of this assignment is to code a solver for a simplified version of this game, with no orange tiles, circles or crosses on the terrain. 
The goal of your program, given a terrain configuration with a start position and a goal position, is to return the exact sequence of keys to 
type in order to reach the goal position. Naturally, we will be interested in getting the shortest path as well.
